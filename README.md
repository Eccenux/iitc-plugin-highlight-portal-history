# IITC plugin: Highlight portals based on history

Use the portal fill color to denote the portal has been visited, captured, scout controlled.

**This is a *fork*** with a better colors (uniteresting portals are transaprent).
Original was created by Johtaja.

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-highlight-portal-history/raw/master/highlight-portal-history.user.js)**.

Usage
------------

Just choose one of highlighter named "History:...". Personaly I mostly use "History: not visited/captured" — this highlighter will clearly show you what you should visit 🚩🚶‍♂️. In this case captured portals are transaprent (not captured red 🔴, not visited yellow 🟡).
